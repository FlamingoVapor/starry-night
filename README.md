# starry-night

Fills your screen with a glimmer of stars and buildings.

An HTML5 port of [the Starry Night animation](https://code.google.com/archive/p/starrynight/), modelled after the original screensaver from the 1990s After Dark series by Berkeley Systems. Not related or affiliated with Berkeley Systems, this is a clone written completely from scratch.

## Features

- **Buildings.** Little window lights, each one a hard little worker.

- **Flasher.** Goes at the center of the top of the tallest building.

- **Rain.** Black drops give the illusion that stars and lights are going back off.

- **Shooting star.** For those watching very closely.
